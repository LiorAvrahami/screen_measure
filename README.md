# Screen Measure

## Introduction

This is a program I made for myself, to measure praportions and distances on the screen of my computer.

## usage

pressing enter captures the cursers position and enters it to one of the two slots. starting from the first slot, then the second slot, and then the first slot, etc..

at any point the distance betwean the two captured points that are currently in the slots is displayed with units of pixles or cm. it is selected wich units to use vi a radio box. the program's pixel to cm convertion can, and should be calibrated by:

1. pressing the red "Calibrate" button, 
2. measuring the distance betwean the close edges of the two rectangles.
3. write down the distance (in the unit system you prefer, text will be written as if it is in cm, but you can use any unit system you want).

**Note that you should calibrate the distance converter before using the cm reading.
